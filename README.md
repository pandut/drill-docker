Access the Apache Drill Web UI

Apache Drill comes with a Web management UI. In order to access this, the port needs to be forwarded to the host running Docker. To do so, please run the Docker container with the -p option to publish the container's port to the host as follows:

docker run -it -p 8047:8047 pandu/apache-drill-docker /drill-scripts/bootstrap.sh
Using Docker on Linux

To access the Apache Drill Web UI please run:

xdg-open http://localhost:8047
Using boot2docker on Mac

When using boot2docker, there is an extra layer in between (the boot2docker virtual machine). To open the Apache Drill Web UI please run:

open http://$(boot2docker ip):8047

This requires version 1.7.0 of boot2docker which includes "Container Port Redirection"
